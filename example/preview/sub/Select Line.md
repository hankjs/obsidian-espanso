Customize the preview of the row

The third line of the file to the end

```preview
path: /sub/color.css
start: 3
```

The first line to the third line

```preview
path: /sub/color.css
end: 3
```

Only preview the third line

```preview
path: /sub/color.css
start: 3
end: 3
```

Use RegExp

`dd\\d{2}` -> `/dd\d{2}/`

If you don't know RegExp, just use text directly. like:

`dd00dd`: match `dd00dd` inside the line


```preview
path: /sub/color.css
start: 1
end: dd\\d{2}
```
